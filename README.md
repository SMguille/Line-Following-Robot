# Line-Following-Robot
Developed an autonomous line-following robot using Arduino, C++, and Fusion 360.
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project involves the **design and development of an autonomous line-following robot**, built by a high school team as part of a robotics curriculum. The robot, named **"Robot Alpha Romeo"**, was developed using **Arduino**, C++ programming, and Fusion 360 for structural design. The objective was to **create a self-navigating robot that follows a black line and avoids obstacles**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Design and assemble a functional **line-following robot**.  
- Develop and integrate **Arduino-based programming** for motor and sensor control.  
- Troubleshoot and optimize **sensor and motor performance**.  
- Implement **obstacle detection and avoidance** features.
